// This directory is intended to hold Jest test files for all utility modules in the electron-app/utils directory.
// Add your test files here.
// For example, if you have a utility module named 'mathUtils.js', you can create a test file named 'mathUtils.test.js' in this directory.
// This will help in organizing your tests and keeping them separate from the main application code.
// You can also create subdirectories for different categories of utilities if needed.
// Make sure to follow the naming convention for test files: <moduleName>.test.js
