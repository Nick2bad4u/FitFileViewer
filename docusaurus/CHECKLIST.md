## 🐛 Known Warnings (Can Ignore)

These warnings are **expected** and safe to ignore:

### TypeDoc Warnings
```
[warning] The entry point .../types/.../*.d.ts is not referenced by the 'files' or 'include' option in your tsconfig
```
**Reason**: Generated `.d.ts` files are outputs, not sources. They're excluded from TypeDoc processing.

### TypeScript Compilation Errors (Before npm install)
```
Cannot find module '@docusaurus/...' or its corresponding type declarations
```
**Reason**: Dependencies not installed yet. Resolved after `npm install`.

## 🚨 Critical Issues to Fix

If you see these, something is wrong:

- ❌ TypeDoc crashes completely (not just warnings)
- ❌ Docusaurus build fails
- ❌ 404 errors on documentation pages
- ❌ Homepage doesn't render
- ❌ Search doesn't work

## 📝 Next Steps After Verification

1. **Customize Content**
   - Update blog posts in `blog/`
   - Add more documentation in `docs/`
   - Update homepage content in `src/pages/index.tsx`

2. **Add Images**
   - Add screenshots to `static/img/screenshots/`
   - Create social card image: `static/img/fitfileviewer-social-card.png`
   - Add favicon: `static/img/favicon.ico`

3. **Deploy**
   - Commit and push to `main` branch
   - GitHub Actions will build and deploy
   - Site will be live at <https://fitfileviewer.typpi.online>

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### TypeDoc Fails

1. Check `typedoc.json` exclude list
2. Run `npm run docs:typedoc` separately to see full output
3. Check electron-app JSDoc comments are valid
4. See `SETUP.md` for detailed troubleshooting

### Build Fails

1. Clear Docusaurus cache: `npm run clear`
2. Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`
3. Reinstall: `npm install`
4. Try building again

### Pages Don't Load

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify all markdown files have proper frontmatter
3. Check `sidebars.ts` references match actual file paths
4. Clear browser cache
