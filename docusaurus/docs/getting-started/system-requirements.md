## 🌐 Network Requirements

FitFileViewer works **completely offline** once installed. However, network access is helpful for:

### Offline Mode

When offline:
- 📊 Charts work fully offline
- 📋 Tables work fully offline
- 📄 Summary works fully offline
- 🗺️ Maps use cached tiles or show placeholder

## ⚡ Performance Tips

### For Better Performance

1. **Close unused applications** to free up memory
2. **Use SSD storage** for faster file loading
3. **Keep graphics drivers updated** for smooth map rendering
4. **Increase available RAM** if working with large files

### For Large Files

1. **Be patient** - large files take time to parse
2. **Consider splitting** very long activities
3. **Use data smoothing** options if available
4. **Export smaller segments** for detailed analysis

## 🔧 Dependencies

FitFileViewer includes all necessary dependencies. No additional software is required.

### Bundled Technologies

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| Electron | Desktop application framework |
| Chart.js | Performance charts |
| Leaflet | Interactive maps |
| DataTables | Data table display |
| Garmin FIT SDK | FIT file parsing |
